# Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) & Penetration Testing Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Penetration Testing assessment** conducted as part of **IFT 475: Security Analysis** at **Arizona State University**. The project evaluates the security posture of a real-world organization (CarGurus) by combining publicly available intelligence gathering with hands-on penetration testing in a controlled lab environment.

The assessment demonstrates how publicly exposed information, outdated systems, and misconfigured services can significantly expand an organization’s attack surface and increase the risk of both external and insider-driven threats.

## My Role & Contributions
I served as a **lead contributor** for this project and was responsible for both **research and documentation ownership** across the majority of the report. My contributions included:

- Compiling and integrating **all team members’ work** into a single cohesive technical report  
- Conducting **independent OSINT research** on the organization  
- Writing the following major sections in full:
  - Introduction  
  - Scope  
  - Company Profile  
  - Executive Leadership Analysis  
  - Financial Exposure Analysis  
  - Security Recommendations  
  - Conclusion  
- Integrating relevant findings from the penetration testing portion into the recommendations
- Creating **all three annexes**, including:
  - References
  - Acronyms
  - Supplemental images, screenshots, and tables
- Ensuring professional structure, consistency, and technical clarity throughout the document

This work reflects both **technical analysis skills** and **security-focused research, writing, and synthesis abilities**.

## Project Scope
The assessment combines two core components:

### 1. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
Publicly available data was collected using techniques such as:
- Google Hacking (advanced search operators)
- Third-party data broker analysis
- Corporate and investor disclosures
- Executive and social media profiling
- Network footprinting using public tools

The goal was to understand how an attacker could leverage publicly accessible information to support reconnaissance, social engineering, and targeted attacks.

### 2. Penetration Testing (Simulated Environment)
Three servers within a controlled lab environment were assessed using industry-standard tools:
- **Nmap**
- **Enum4Linux**
- **Nessus**
- **Metasploit**
- **Nikto**

Testing focused on identifying exposed services, outdated systems, misconfigurations, and exploitable vulnerabilities while remaining non-destructive.

## Key Findings
- **Server 1** demonstrated a strong security posture consistent with a well-hardened Active Directory Domain Controller.
- **Server 2** presented critical risks, including outdated operating systems, exposed NFS shares, weak access controls, and exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **Server 3** ran end-of-life software with multiple exposed services, weak cryptographic settings, and outdated web components.

Across the organization, OSINT findings revealed:
- Excessive executive personal data exposure
- Publicly indexed internal financial documents
- Increased social engineering and insider threat risk
